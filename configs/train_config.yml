# Data Paths
img_dir: Dataset/Images # Path to images directory - see README for expected file structure.
mask_dir: Dataset/Segmentations # Path to masks directory - see README for expected file structure.

# Model Configuration
model_str: unet # Model architecture: demo_unet (example unet implementation shown in practical) or unet (personal implementation).
output_dir: runs/local_training/local_model # Directory to save outputs of training. Include model weights, train metrics and config file.
model_weights_path: null # Path to pre-trained model weights.

# Training Parameters
lr: 0.1 # Learning rate for training.
epochs: 10 # Number of epochs to train the model.
batch_size: 3 # Batch size for training operations.

# Data Handling
only_foreground_slices: false # Only include slices with non-zero foreground in the dataset.
invert_masks: false # Whether to invert background and foreground in masks.

# Experimentation Mode
quick_test: false # Enables quick test mode using only one case slice to test the pipeline.
visualise: false # Visualise the model prediction on a random case after every epoch during training.
                 # (NOTE: visualisations will be uploaded to wandb regardless).

# Loss Configuration
loss: dice_and_bce # Loss function to use during training. Combination of Dice and Binary Cross Entropy.
